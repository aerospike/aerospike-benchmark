 *
 *    I) Generate an integer bin or value in a specific byte range (treat I as I4)

 *        I8 for 2^56 - 2^64-1
 *    B) Generate a bytes bin or value with an bytearray of random bytes
 *        B12 - generates a bytearray of 12 random bytes
 *    S) Generate a string bin or value made of space-separated a-z{1,9} words
 *        S16 - a string with a 16 character length. ex: "uir a mskd poiur"
 *    D) Generate a Double bin or value (8 byte)
 *
 * Collection bins:
 *     [] - a list
 *         [3*I2] - ex: [312, 1651, 756]
 *         [I2, S4, I2] - ex: [892, "sf b", 8712]

 *         [3*[I1, I1]] - ex: [[1,11],[123,321],[78,241]]
 *
 *     {} - a map

 *         {2*S1:[3*I:1]} - ex {"a": [1,2,3], "b": [6,7,8]}
